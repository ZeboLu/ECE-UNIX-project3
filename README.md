# ECE-UNIX-project3

Project 3 is basically a reproduction of Project 1 but in Python. It receices 2 arguments. The first is the root of the directory tree and the second is the name of a output HTML file. Then it travers through all the visible directories and subdirectories listing and linking to the files whitin with leveled indentation. The directory is listed before the files in that directory are listed.

The mapFiles.py has already been made executable, which means it could be run with either Python Interpreter or the execution command in the shell.
